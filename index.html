         found in cool <br> waters close to the coast. They can grow up to 4.6
         meters long and can swim over <br> 60km per hour! The Great White can
         have a set of 300 sharp teeth to help chow <br> down it's prey. Their
         menu generally consists of sea mammals such as sea lions, <br> seals
         and baby whales. New born Great Whites are called pups. These incredible
         <br> creatures are at the top of the food chain! </td>

            front of their small <br> dorsal fin. These whales can grow from 15
            to 19 meters long and can weigh <br> around 40 tons! Humpback
            Whales are baleen whales which means that they <br >have filter
            feeding systems in their mouths. Their food mostly consists of krill,
            <br> anchovies, sardines and mackerel. Humpback Whales can live up
            to 50 years <br> but some have observed them to live longer. </td>

            of the dolphine <br> family. They are known for their long dorsal
            fin and their black and white coloring. <br> The black and white
            coloring helps camouflage them by obscuring their outline in <br>
            the water. Orcas are apex predators and can swim around 56km per
            hour. They <br> feed on different types of prey such as fish, seals,
            sea birds and squid. Orcas are <br> social creatures and they live in
            family groups called pods! </td>
